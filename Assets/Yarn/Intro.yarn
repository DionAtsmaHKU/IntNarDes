I close the door behind me, put my sneakers on and take a good look onto the street...
//introduction/scene buildup, goldie introduction
...It's the first day of school after spring break!
It's a beautiful day outside, the sun is shining, the birds are singing their morning songs, the flowers are blooming brightly with the sunrise...
...and I, Goldie, am SO READY TO START UP SCHOOL AGAIN!!!
The spring breeze is hitting me gently as im walking to the bus stop. I see teens my age walk to the stop too, some i recognize from Miss Apples class, others from miss Jeans...
I'm not that much of a school person, It's not like I'm a nerd for grades or anything in Claw Academy, it's just...
...I miss my friends, really! Caspur, Capri, Erin...
//bump into Archie
Goldie: ...Archie? //whispering
As I get to the bus stop, I see a familiar face peek through the glass walls...
Goldie: ARCHIE!!!
Archie: GOLDIE!!!
I Jump into their arms and they jump into mine and we give eachother a big ol' hug!
Goldie: Good to see you, girl!! //gender neutral tone tag
//entering convo on what you did in spring break
Archie: You too, you too! How've you been?
Goldie: Oh ive been great! Just spending the days working around the house, relaxing, baking, baking again, walking along the pier, baking again again, watching stuff on Cats Eye TV Plus, you now? the new show Weevilance is SO good! Oh I gotta tell you all about it-
Archie: Yo, breathe!!
Archie: We can catch up during miss Jeans's class, no worries, dude.
